## System Design, Scalability, Data Handling
(Source: https://github.com/sigmakappa/coding-interview-university#system-design-scalability-data-handling)

**You can expect system design questions if you have 4+ years of experience.**

- Scalability and System Design are very large topics with many topics and resources, since
      there is a lot to consider when designing a software/hardware system that can scale.
      Expect to spend quite a bit of time on this.
- Considerations:
    - scalability
        - Distill large data sets to single values
        - Transform one data set to another
        - Handling obscenely large amounts of data
    - system design
        - features sets
        - interfaces
        - class hierarchies
        - designing a system under certain constraints
        - simplicity and robustness
        - tradeoffs
        - performance analysis and optimization

- [ ] Practicing the system design process: Here are some ideas to try working through on paper, each with some documentation on how it was handled in the real world:
    - review: [The System Design Primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
    - [System Design from HiredInTech](http://www.hiredintech.com/system-design/)
    - [cheat sheet](https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university/blob/master/extras/cheat%20sheets/system-design.pdf)
    - flow:
        1. Understand the problem and scope:
            - define the use cases, with interviewer's help
            - suggest additional features
            - remove items that interviewer deems out of scope
            - assume high availability is required, add as a use case
        2. Think about constraints:
            - ask how many requests per month
            - ask how many requests per second (they may volunteer it or make you do the math)
            - estimate reads vs. writes percentage
            - keep 80/20 rule in mind when estimating
            - how much data written per second
            - total storage required over 5 years
            - how much data read per second
        3. Abstract design:
            - layers (service, data, caching)
            - infrastructure: load balancing, messaging
            - rough overview of any key algorithm that drives the service
            - consider bottlenecks and determine solutions
